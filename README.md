# Game Platform API
The aim for this project is to link a simple unity game with a website. The user should be able to apply some minor in-game settings that will take effect next time the game is played as well as displaying the user highscore. The game itself will hold the top 10 overall highscore as well as holding a logged in user with it's settings. 

## Website
- Show user highscore
- Change minor in-game settings

## Unity
- Playable game
- Top 10 highscores
- Settings based on user
